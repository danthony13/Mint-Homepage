# Mint-Homepage
This is an old project I did around January 2016 for The Odin Project. The tast was to make a copy of the Mint sign up page using just HTML and CSS. The design isn't repsonsive, and it's a good way to see how far my coding has come in just a few months. I really like the simplicity and shading used on the Mint signup page.
